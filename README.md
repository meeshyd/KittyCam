# KittyCam
This is a hobby project I chose to pursue in order to familiarize myself with my new Raspberry Pi. The Kitty Cam is powered by a Raspberry Pi Node.js app and uses a camera and PIR motion sensor.  

This repo houses the back end of the app. For the front end application, please visit [here](https://github.com/meeshyd/KittyCam-live).

Many thanks to [GirlieMac](https://github.com/girliemac/RPi-KittyCam) for the awesome idea and tutorial!
